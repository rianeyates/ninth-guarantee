    <p>In August 1961 the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany">East German</a> government built the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall">Berlin Wall</a>, ending freedom of movement between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Berlin">East</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Berlin">West Berlin</a>. As a result, the Berlin public transit network, which had formerly spanned both halves of the city, was also divided into two. Some <i>U-</i> and <i>S-Bahn</i> lines fell entirely into one half of the city or the other; other lines were divided between the two jurisdictions, with trains running only to the border and then turning back. However, there were three lines—the <i>U-Bahn</i> lines now designated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U6_(Berlin_U-Bahn)">U6</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U8_(Berlin_U-Bahn)">U8</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Nord-S%C3%BCd-Tunnel"><i>Nord–Süd</i> Tunnel</a> on the <i>S-Bahn</i>—that ran for the most part through West Berlin but passed through a relatively short stretch of East Berlin territory in the city centre. These lines continued to be open to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Berlin">West Berliners</a>; however, trains did not stop at most of the stations located within <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Berlin">East Berlin</a>, though for technical reasons they did have to slow down significantly while passing through. (Trains did stop at <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Friedrichstra%C3%9Fe_railway_station">Friedrichstraße</a></i>, on which more below.) The name <i>Geisterbahnhof</i> was soon aptly applied to these dimly lit, heavily guarded stations by travelers from West Berlin, who watched them pass by through the carriage windows. However, the term was never official; West Berlin subway maps of the period simply labelled these stations "<i>Bahnhöfe, auf denen die Züge nicht halten</i>" ("stations at which the trains do not stop"). East Berlin subway maps neither depicted the West Berlin lines nor the ghost stations. <i>U-Bahn</i> maps in the <i>Friedrichstraße</i> transfer station were unique: They depicted all the Western lines, but not the <i>Geisterbahnhöfe</i>, and showed the city divided into "<i>Berlin, Hauptstadt der DDR</i>" ("Berlin, capital of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany">German Democratic Republic</a>") and "<i>Westberlin</i>", the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Berlin#Naming_conventions">official terminology</a> used by East Germany.</p>
    <p>The situation was obviously less than ideal. The lines were a vital part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Berlin">West Berlin</a> transit network, but because part of the route of some of the lines lay in East Berlin territory, it was difficult for Western support staff to perform maintenance work on the tracks and tunnels. If a train on a West Berlin line broke down in East Berlin territory, then passengers had to wait for Eastern border police to appear and escort them out. The East German government occasionally hinted that it might someday block access to the tunnels at the border and run its own service on the East Berlin sections of these lines. However, this awkward status quo persisted for the entire 28-year period of the division of Berlin.</p>
    <p>At the closed stations, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbed_wire">barbed wire</a> fences were installed to prevent any would-be escapees from East Berlin from accessing the track bed, and the electrically live third rail served as an additional and potentially lethal deterrent. An alarm was triggered if anyone breached one of the barriers. As for the entrances, the signage was removed, walkways were walled up and stairways were sealed with concrete slabs. Police stations were built into the windowed platform service booths, from which the whole platform area could be monitored.</p>
    <p>A wide white line on the wall marked the exact location of the border. Later, gates were installed at some stations that could be rolled into place at night while the guards were off-duty. Guard posts at other stations were staffed continuously, creating additional employment positions with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapos">transport police</a>. In the platform area, the guards always worked in pairs, and care was taken in their assignment to assure that there would be no personal ties between them. In addition, superior officers could conduct surprise inspections at any time, thus, maintaining maximum security. Other stations were secured by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenztruppen_der_DDR">East German border guards</a>.</p>
    <h3>Particular stations</h3>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Friedrichstra%C3%9Fe_railway_station"><i>Friedrichstraße</i> station</a>, though served by Western lines and located in East Berlin territory, was not a <i>Geisterbahnhof</i>. Instead, it served as a transfer point between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U6_(Berlin_U-Bahn)">U6</a> and several <i>S-Bahn</i> lines. Western passengers could walk from one platform to another without ever leaving the station or having to show papers, much like air travellers changing planes at an international airport. Westerners with appropriate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_(document)">visas</a> could also enter East Berlin there.</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bornholmer_Strasse_railway_station"><i>Bornholmer Straße S-Bahn</i> station</a> was the only ghost station not located in a tunnel. It was situated close to the wall near the <i>Bornholmer Straße</i> border crossing. West Berlin trains passed through it without stopping. East Berlin <i>S-Bahn</i> trains passed the same station but on different tracks. The tracks used by Western and Eastern trains were sealed off from each other by a tall fence.</p>
    <p>Another oddity was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wollankstra%C3%9Fe_railway_station"><i>Wollankstraße</i> station</a>. Like <i>Bornholmer Straße</i>, it was an <i>S-Bahn</i> stop served by West Berlin trains, but located on East Berlin territory just behind the border. However, <i>Wollankstraße</i> was in use and accessible for West Berliners, as one of its exits opened on a West Berlin street. This exit was exactly on the border line, a warning sign next to it informing passengers about the situation. Its other exits to East Berlin streets were blocked.</p>

      <div>The reopening of <i>Jannowitzbrücke U-Bahn</i> station on 11 November 1989, the first of the ghost stations to be reopened after the Fall of the Berlin Wall</div>
    </div>
    <p>The first people to enter the ghost stations after the fall of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall">Berlin Wall</a> in November 1989 found that they lived up to their informal name, with ads and signage on the walls unchanged since 1961. None of them have been preserved.</p>
    <p>The first ghost station to reopen to passenger traffic was <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Jannowitzbr%C3%BCcke_railway_station">Jannowitzbrücke</a></i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U8_(Berlin_U-Bahn)">U8</a>) on 11 November 1989, two days after the fall of the Wall. It was equipped with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_checkpoint">checkpoint</a> within the station akin to <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Friedrichstra%C3%9Fe_railway_station">Friedrichstraße</a></i>, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_border_crossings">East German customs and border control</a> were provisionally installed to facilitate passengers heading to or coming from East Berlin. Hand-drawn destination signs were hung up covering the old ones from pre-1961; these signs were both crumbling from age and obviously missing the termini of post-1961 line extensions. On 22 December 1989, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenthaler_Platz_(Berlin_U-Bahn)">Rosenthaler Platz</a></i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U8_(Berlin_U-Bahn)">U8</a>) was reopened with a similar provisional checkpoint.</p>
    <p>On 12 April 1990, the third station to reopen was <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernauer_Stra%C3%9Fe_(Berlin_U-Bahn)">Bernauer Straße</a></i> (U8). As its northern exit was directly on the border, it could be opened with direct access to West Berlin without the need of a checkpoint. Its southern exit towards East Berlin was not reopened until 1 July 1990.</p>
    <p>Discussions on reopening all the U6 and U8 stations including the S-Bahn station <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Oranienburger_Stra%C3%9Fe_railway_station">Oranienburger Straße</a></i>, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Brandenburger_Tor_railway_station">Unter den Linden</a></i> and <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Nordbahnhof">Nordbahnhof</a></i> had begun on 13 April 1990 without border controls. These took two months to clean up, removing all the dirt and refurbishing the interiors; all stations had been reopened on 1 July 1990 at 11 a.m., as East Berlin and East Germany had adopted the West German currency (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Mark">DM</a>), leaving the border checkpoints abandoned.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <p>On 2 July 1990, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Oranienburger_Stra%C3%9Fe_railway_station">Oranienburger Straße</a></i> was the first ghost station on the <i>Nord-Süd-S-Bahn</i> to reopen. On 1 September 1990, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Brandenburger_Tor_railway_station">Unter den Linden</a></i> and <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Nordbahnhof">Nordbahnhof</a></i> were opened following reconstruction works. On 12 December 1990, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Bornholmer_Stra%C3%9Fe_railway_station">Bornholmer Straße</a></i> was reopened for West Berlin trains; a second platform for East Berlin trains allowing interchange followed on 5 August 1991. The very last ghost station to reopen was <i>Potsdamer Platz</i>, which opened on 3 March 1992, following an extensive restoration of the entire North–South tunnel.</p>
    <p>In the following years, the city and German government put a great deal of effort into restoring and reunifying the <i>S-Bahn</i> and <i>U-Bahn</i> networks in Berlin. The U-Bahn system reached its pre-war status in 1995 with the reopening of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Warschauer_Stra%C3%9Fe_railway_station">Warschauer Straße</a></i> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U1_(Berlin_U-Bahn)">U1</a>. The <i>S-Bahn</i> system reached a preliminary completion in 2002 (with the reopening of the ring), even though there are still disused sections of lines closed in the aftermath of the wall. Decisions on reopening of some of these sections are still to be made.</p>
